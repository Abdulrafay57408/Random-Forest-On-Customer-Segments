# **Customer Spending Analysis - Predictive Modeling Project**  

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Predictive Modeling for Customer Spending Behavior**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics, spending behavior, and engagement patterns using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning**. The goal is to predict customer **Spending Scores** using demographic and behavioral features to optimize marketing strategies.  

## **📂 Dataset Description**  
The dataset includes:  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Level, Income Level  
- **Behavioral Data**: Interactions with customer service, Preferred Communication Channel, Segmentation Group  
- **Transactional Data**: Coverage Amount, Premium Amount, Purchase Frequency  
- **Target Variable**: **Spending Score** (used for regression modeling)  

## **🛠 Tools & Libraries Used**  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📑  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib 🎨  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  

## **📊 Key Steps**  
✔ **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed outliers, and encoded categorical variables.  
✔ **EDA & Feature Engineering** – Created **Purchase Frequency**, **Income Range**, and other derived features.  
✔ **Model Training & Evaluation** – Trained a **Random Forest Regressor**, achieving high accuracy.  

## **🔍 Key Insights**  
- **Age & Income Trends**: Majority of customers fall within **32-57 years**, with an average income of **\$82K**.  
- **Spending Patterns**: Mid-income customers (\$50K–\$80K) exhibit **higher purchase frequencies**.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: **Segments 3 & 5** have the most engagement, while Segment 2 underperforms.  
- **Product Preferences**: Policies **`policy1` & `policy5`** are the most popular.  

## **⚙️ Model Performance**  
✅ **Algorithm Used**: **Random Forest Regressor**  
✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 169.78  
✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 54,686.92  
✅ **R-squared (R²)**: 0.9999
